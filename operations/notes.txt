uint8 has the best division times

unsigned has much better division performance for the same size.  

double has best add mul sub performance, but float has better div performance.  

long doubles are just slow in general.  Makes since since they're 2x word size

uint64 division is much slower than 16 and 32

All the other comparisons you could think of, increasing the # bytes or switching from signed to unsigned don't really seem to make any appreciable difference at all.
